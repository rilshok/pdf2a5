- Allows customization of the number of pages in each batch.
- Maintains the original content layout while resizing pages to fit the A5 format.

## Installation

To use the PDF to A5 Booklet Converter, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed.
3. Install the module project directory by `pip install .`

## Usage

The command-line interface allows you to easily convert PDF files into A5 booklets. Here's how to use it:

```bash
pdf2a5 SOURCE_PDF [DESTINATION_DIRECTORY] [--dpi DPI] [--batch BATCH_SIZE]
```

- `SOURCE_PDF` (string): The path to the source PDF file you want to convert.
- `DESTINATION_DIRECTORY` (optional string): The directory where the converted PDF booklets will be saved. If not provided, the tool will create a directory for the output files in the current working directory.
- `--dpi` `DPI` (optional integer): The resolution in dots per inch (DPI) for rendering images. The default value is 300 DPI, because this provides excellent quality when printing on A4 paper, but does not result in an excessively large output file size.
- `--batch` `BATCH_SIZE` (optional integer): The number of pages to be included in each batch. The default value is 4, as A5 booklets printed on 80 g/mÂ² A4 paper are easy to fold when they consist of 4 sheets (16 A5 pages).
